# Employee_BurnRate_Prediction_Model
Predicting employee burnout using data-driven models is essential for proactive intervention, allowing organizations to implement targeted support strategies, foster a healthier work culture, and sustain long-term productivity.This project aims to build and compare the performance of several regression machine learning model to predict employee burnout rate from data such as gender, hours worked per day, designation, and the like.

## 1. Problem Statement
Today, burnout is often described as 'The Great Exhaustion' because according to a study published by Mercer in 2024, 8 out of 10 employees are at risk of burnout. It thus comes as no surprise that HR departments are very interested in monitoring their employees' burnout rate. Without early detection, burnout often results in increased absenteeism, higher turnover rates, and a steep rise in recruitment and training costs, ultimately undermining the organization's competitive edge Understanding and predicting employee burnout rates with machine learning can provide organizations with the right insights to create supportive and healthy environments in the workplace as well as sustain long-tern prodductivity.

## 2.Data
The dataset used for this project consists of HR Analytics data including, when an employee joined the company, there level in the company, gender, whether work from home options are available, their mental fatigue score, among other features and the target variable, the burn out rate.

## 3.Exploratory Data Analysis
#### 3.1 Handling missingness
All rows with missing values in the target variable were droped. Missingness in the 'Resource Allocation' and 'Mental Fatigue Score' were imputed using median and mean respectively based on their distributions.
